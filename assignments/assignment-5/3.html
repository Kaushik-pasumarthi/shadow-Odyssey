      Chennai, on the Bay of Bengal in eastern India, is the capital of the state of Tamil Nadu.<br/> The city is home to Fort St. George, built in 1644 and now a museum showcasing the city’s roots as a British military garrison and East India Company trading outpost, when it was called Madras. Religious sites include Kapaleeshwarar Temple, adorned with carved and painted gods, and St. Mary’s, a 17th-century Anglican church.    </p>
